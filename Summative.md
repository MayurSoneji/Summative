# Proximity and  Continuation

## What do they mean?
**Proximity:** Nearness in space, time, or relationship.

**Continuation:** The action of carrying something on over time or the state of being carried on.

### Things we can associate with Proximity
* A car Park
* A light source
* Any two or multiple objects close to each other
* And more

### Things we can associate with Continuation
* Train Tracks
* Roads
* Time
* Movement of the universe
* Life
* And more

## Our Own Images

### _Train Tracks_

This image was taken to show the continuation of the train track, later on in this presenation I will show you a longer train track. I was limited to how I could take the picture based on the fact I had a door between me and the tracks.

**Why is this continuation?**

As we mentioned earlier, continuation is something carrying on, and this is what the train tracks represent very well as there is no start nor finish and they continue outside of the picture frames.

### _Train Passing_

In this video, you can see the train passing quickly and each carriage that passes is exactly the same. Again this is continuation as it looks like the train never ends in the video.

### _Water Ripples_

I am sure that everyone knows this is outside the O2 Arena. The water ripples are within close proximity and is also a good example of continuation. The ripples is continuing to go on for a long period of time until the water has been turned off, otherwise the ripples will keep on repeating itself.

**In This next series of images, I have tried to capture (in my opinion) what Continuation and Proximity is, using visual perception within the home**

### _Floorboards_

![FLoorboards](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_20161008_180732.jpg "Tiles")

This is an image of floorboards, I decided to use this due to the repitition of the wooden planks, I feel this conveys contiuation quite well. Aswell as being visually apealling.

### _Keys_

![Keys](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_20161008_181235.jpg "Keyboard")

Here I have captured an image of piano keys. The keys are going off the image which is continuation and the keys are next to each other in a close proximity.

### _Bricks_

![Bricks](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_20161008_181429.jpg "Bricks")

I used this image as I tried to capture continuation aswell as proximity, I attempted this by focusing in on the first brick alowing the rest of the bricks to becoming more obscured.

### _Heater_

![Heater](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_20161008_181601.jpg "Heaters")

This is an image of a wall heater I decided to use this picture as I feel the angle of the shot helps to display continuation, aswell as the contrast of the colours within the image blend well together.

### _Radiator_

![Radiator](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_20161008_181959.jpg "Radiator")

This is my favourite image of the series this is due to the deception the camera has created by being angled over the radiator, I feel this gives the picture alot of depth and repition which ties in proximity and continuation. In addition, as the shadows created by surrouding lighting which is hitting the white radiator, it gives off a three-dimensional effect.

### _Stairs_

![Stairs](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_20161008_181743.jpg "Stairs")

Here I have captured an image of a staircase, the picture displays a good example of continuation with the stairs extending with the image; this also conveys proximity, with the final stairs appearing alot smaller and fainter than the closer ones which you can see the texture on the carpet.

### _Street_

![Street](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_1068.jpg "Street")

Here is an image of a street, which is a good example of a continuation not only with the road but the cars all lined up down the street offers up a continuation.

## Other Relevant Things (Content not by us)

**In this section we will discuss things we have found online which is relevant to our topics.**

### NFC

This image is the logo for NFC, I haven't been able to show you the individual proximity sensor in your phone which is used by the NFC however I have attached a video of someone using Android Pay which is an NFC payment method which can be used practically anywhere which has contactless!

### Car Park

![CarPark](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/CarPark.jpg "CarPark")

This image shows close proximity between the cars because of the way they have parked, there is minimal gap between the cars. The car park as a whole is also continuation based on this image as they still continue.

### WiFi

![Wifi](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/Wifi.png "Wifi")

WiFi is an everyday thing people use now, regardless of location. WiFi has even expanded underground at some stations. The WiFi can only be picked up if the phone is in close proximity to the router. For example, as the train moves along, the radius from the router to the phone increases until the phone is not in range to the router, therefore not in close proximity.

### Proximity Sensor

![Proximity Sensor](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/proximity.jpg "Proximity")

This is an excercise, I would like everyone to take their phone out and look at the top end of the phone for a sensor. This is known as a proximity sensor, this measures the light level of the area you are in and informs the screen for the brightness level. If the proximity sensor senses pure darkness, as if you had your phone in your pocket, the screen will NOT turn on, if you have that enabled in the settings.

### Train Tracks

![Tracks](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/tracks.jpg "Tracks")

Like I had mentioned before, I would show a train track to show continuation. The wooden planks that make up this type of track is spaced within a close proximity to each other. The track as a whole disappears in the horizon and also continues beyond the image.
